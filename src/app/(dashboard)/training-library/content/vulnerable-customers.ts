    content: `A recently bereaved customer calls your firm. They are exhausted, overwhelmed by paperwork, and struggling to access joint funds to pay essential bills. Your standard process requires multiple documents and online forms. The agent is under pressure to keep call times low.

At the same time:
• FG21/1 says a vulnerable customer is "someone who, due to their personal circumstances, is especially susceptible to harm, particularly when a firm is not acting with appropriate levels of care."
• The FCA wants vulnerable customers to achieve outcomes as good as those for other customers and receive consistently fair treatment.
• In 2025, the FCA's vulnerability review found good practice but also serious failings – rigid processes after bereavement, poor recognition of distress, and additional harm from complex admin.

The gap between policy and practice is where harm happens. Your firm may have a vulnerability policy, but if frontline staff can't deviate from scripts and processes, if systems don't flag vulnerability, if managers are measured only on efficiency – the policy is just words.`,

        mainContent: `**The FCA Definition**

The FCA defines a vulnerable customer as:

"Someone who, due to their personal circumstances, is especially susceptible to harm, particularly when a firm is not acting with appropriate levels of care."

**Key Points About This Definition:**

• Vulnerability is a **spectrum of risk**, not a fixed label
• **Any customer** can become vulnerable at any time
• Vulnerability is often **temporary** (life events) but can be long-term (chronic health)
• It is the firm's **responsibility** to act with appropriate care – vulnerability increases harm when firms fail to adapt
• The definition focuses on **susceptibility to harm**, not characteristics of customers

**FCA Objectives for Vulnerable Customers:**

1. Vulnerable customers should experience **outcomes as good as** those for other customers
2. Vulnerable customers should receive **consistently fair treatment** across all firms and sectors
3. Firms should take **proactive steps** to identify and support vulnerable customers
4. Vulnerability considerations should be **embedded** throughout the business, not siloed

---

**The Four Key Drivers of Vulnerability**

The FCA groups vulnerability into four categories of drivers. Most vulnerable customers experience multiple drivers simultaneously.

**1. Health**
• Physical health conditions (mobility issues, chronic pain, sensory impairments)
• Mental health conditions (depression, anxiety, PTSD, bipolar disorder)
• Cognitive impairments (dementia, learning disabilities, brain injury)
• Addictions (gambling, alcohol, drugs)
• Long-term or terminal illness

Impact: May affect ability to understand information, communicate effectively, manage tasks, or make complex decisions.

**2. Life Events**
• Bereavement (loss of spouse, parent, child)
• Relationship breakdown (divorce, separation)
• Job loss or redundancy
• Caring responsibilities (for children, elderly parents, disabled family members)
• Serious accident or injury
• Domestic abuse or coercive control
• Migration or displacement
• Involvement in the criminal justice system

Impact: Often time-limited but can significantly increase stress, reduce capacity, and create urgent financial pressures.

**3. Resilience**
• Low or volatile income
• Lack of savings or financial cushion
• High debt levels relative to income
• Over-indebtedness
• Limited emotional resilience or support networks
• Precarious housing or employment

Impact: Reduces ability to withstand financial or emotional shocks; small problems can quickly escalate.

**4. Capability**
• Low financial literacy or confidence
• Poor numeracy or literacy skills
• Limited digital skills or access
• Limited English language skills
• Learning disabilities
• Lack of experience with financial products

Impact: Makes it harder to understand products, navigate processes, or advocate for themselves.

---

**Interaction with Consumer Duty**

The Consumer Duty (Principle 12 and PRIN 2A) raises standards for all customers and explicitly requires firms to consider characteristics of vulnerability:

**Cross-Cutting Rules Applied to Vulnerability:**

• **Act in good faith** – don't exploit vulnerability or lack of understanding
• **Avoid causing foreseeable harm** – harm is more foreseeable for vulnerable customers
• **Enable and support customers** – account for limitations in capability or resilience

The FCA's 2025 vulnerable customer review frames this as: "Consumer Duty + FG21/1 = higher, outcomes-focused expectations for vulnerable customers."

FG21/1 is not a separate regime – it explains how existing obligations apply in the context of vulnerability. The Consumer Duty amplifies these expectations.`,

        learningPoint: 'Apply vulnerability considerations to customer understanding, product design, communications and support',
        mainContent: `FG21/1 and the 2025 FCA review emphasise four main areas where firms must embed vulnerability: culture & governance, understanding customer needs, product & journey design, and communications & support.

**Understanding Your Vulnerable Customer Base**

Firms cannot support vulnerable customers if they don't know who they are. Data and insight should inform:

**What to Understand:**
• How many customers show vulnerability indicators
• Which drivers are most common in your customer base
• Where vulnerability is likely to surface in customer journeys
• Whether outcomes differ for vulnerable vs non-vulnerable customers

**Key Touchpoints Where Vulnerability Surfaces:**
• Onboarding and affordability checks
• Collections and arrears management
• Claims processing (especially complex or disputed claims)
• Bereavement and third-party notifications
• Fraud and scam victims
• Complaints and disputes
• Product changes, renewals and exits

**Data Sources:**
• Complaints and root cause analysis
• Arrears and forbearance patterns
• Support line interactions and call recordings
• Vulnerability flags in CRM systems
• Customer research and feedback
• Industry benchmarking

---

**Designing Products and Journeys with Vulnerability in Mind**

The FCA expects vulnerability to be considered at the design stage, not retrofitted.

**Good Practice Includes:**
• Build **flexibility** into processes – allow staff to deviate from standard procedures where justified
• Avoid products or features likely to cause **disproportionate harm** to customers with common vulnerabilities
• Test journeys with customers who have different vulnerability characteristics
• Ensure digital journeys have **assisted alternatives** for those who can't self-serve
• Design **exit processes** that don't trap vulnerable customers in unsuitable products
• Consider how product features interact with vulnerability (e.g. complex fee structures, short decision windows)

**Questions for Product Design:**
• Who might struggle with this product or process?
• What would happen if a customer with [specific vulnerability] tried to use this?
• Are we relying on capabilities that vulnerable customers may lack?
• How would a bereaved family member navigate this process?

---

**Communications & Channel Design**

The FCA's vulnerable customer guidance and Consumer Duty consumer understanding outcome overlap strongly here.

**Communication Principles:**
• Use **plain language** – avoid jargon, complex sentences, and unnecessary technical terms
• Provide **layered communications** – key points upfront, more detail available for those who want it
• Offer **multiple channels** – phone, digital, post, assisted digital, face-to-face where appropriate
• Allow customers to **switch channels** where their preferred channel isn't working
• Test communications with customers who have different capability levels

**Avoiding Digital Exclusion:**
• Don't force digital-only journeys for high-stakes decisions
• Provide telephone support with reasonable wait times
• Offer paper alternatives where needed
• Consider assisted digital options (staff helping customers navigate online)
• Monitor which customer groups struggle with digital channels

**AI and Automation Warning:**
The FCA has warned that rapid adoption of AI and automated tools can compound harm for vulnerable customers if not carefully designed. Chatbots, automated decision-making, and digital-only processes may exclude or disadvantage vulnerable customers.

---

**Support, Collections and Complaints**

The 2025 FCA review highlights particular weaknesses in bereavement handling, power of attorney processes, and support during crises.

**Expectations:**
• Staff should be trained to **recognise distress** and adjust tone, pace and process
• Firms should **not rigidly apply** standard procedures where they would cause avoidable harm
• Complaint and collections processes must avoid **unreasonable barriers**
• Vulnerable customers should not have to **repeat their story** multiple times
• Forbearance options should be genuinely available and clearly communicated
• Exit and switching should not be harder than entry

**Collections Specifically:**
• Recognise signs of financial distress and adjust approach
• Offer meaningful forbearance options (payment holidays, reduced payments, interest freezes)
• Don't use aggressive tactics that exploit vulnerability
• Refer to debt advice where appropriate
• Monitor outcomes to ensure collections activity isn't causing disproportionate harm`,

        learningPoint: 'Implement effective governance, outcome-focused MI, and capability building for vulnerable customers',
        mainContent: `**Governance and Accountability**

FG21/1 expects senior leaders to create a culture that prioritises reducing harm to vulnerable customers and empowers staff to act.

**Board and Senior Management Responsibilities:**
• Approve and oversee the firm's vulnerability strategy
• Regularly review MI on vulnerable customer outcomes
• Challenge where outcomes are poor or where vulnerable customers are under-represented in MI
• Ensure adequate resources for vulnerability support
• Set the tone from the top – vulnerability is a priority, not a box-ticking exercise

**SM&CR Considerations:**
• Consumer Duty Champion (where appointed) should have visibility of vulnerability outcomes
• SMF16 (Compliance Oversight) should ensure vulnerability is embedded in compliance monitoring
• Relevant SMFs should be able to evidence how their areas support vulnerable customers

**Culture and Empowerment:**
• Staff must feel empowered to deviate from standard processes where needed
• There should be no punishment for taking time to support vulnerable customers
• Escalation routes should be clear and accessible
• Good practice should be recognised and shared

---

**Data and Outcome-Focused MI**

The FCA's 2025 review emphasises that firms must move beyond policy statements to measurable outcomes.

**What to Measure:**

**Process Metrics:**
• Volumes of vulnerability flags and referrals
• Types of vulnerabilities identified
• Support options offered and taken up
• Forbearance arrangements in place
• Training completion rates

**Outcome Metrics (Critical):**
• Outcomes for vulnerable customers vs non-vulnerable customers:
  - Complaint volumes and resolution times
  - Arrears and default rates
  - Claims acceptance and processing times
  - Customer satisfaction scores
  - Time to resolve issues
  - Financial detriment suffered

**Complaints Analysis:**
• Complaints involving vulnerable customers (explicitly tracked)
• Root cause analysis – are processes causing harm?
• Remediation effectiveness

**Board MI Should Include:**
• Summary of vulnerable customer outcomes vs targets
• Comparison with non-vulnerable customer outcomes
• Key issues and remediation plans
• Resource adequacy assessment
• Emerging risks and themes

---

**Training and Capability**

The FCA expects role-specific training that goes beyond awareness to practical application.

**Frontline Staff Training:**
• Recognising cues and disclosures of vulnerability
• Handling sensitive conversations with empathy
• Adapting communication style (pace, language, checking understanding)
• Using available tools and support options
• Escalation routes and when to use them
• Recording vulnerability appropriately
• Avoiding tipping into harmful territory (over-promising, dependency)

**Product and Journey Owners:**
• Designing with vulnerability in mind
• Building appropriate flexibility into processes
• Using MI to identify harm points
• Testing with diverse customer groups

**Senior Management:**
• Reading and interpreting vulnerability MI
• Challenging culture and resource levels
• Understanding regulatory expectations
• Responding when outcomes are poor

**Training Approach:**
• Use real case studies and scenarios
• Include customer voice and lived experience
• Regular refreshers, not one-off modules
• Feedback loops from QA, complaints, and customer research
• Assessment to confirm understanding, not just completion

---

**Continuous Improvement**

Vulnerability support should not be static. Firms should:

• Regularly review outcomes data and identify improvement opportunities
• Learn from complaints and near-misses
• Stay current with FCA communications and enforcement trends
• Benchmark against good practice in the industry
• Seek customer feedback on support effectiveness
• Update training and processes as understanding evolves`,
