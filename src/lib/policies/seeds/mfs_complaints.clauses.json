If your complaint relates to a payment service and you are not eligible for the Financial Ombudsman Service, you may raise it with the Payment Systems Regulator (complaints@psr.org.uk).\nThe full contact details for the Financial Ombudsman Service are detailed below and further information can be found in the enclosed Ombudsman leaflet:\nWrite to: Financial Ombudsman Service, Exchange Tower, London, E14 9SR\nPhone: 0800 0 234 567 (free from landlines) or 0300 123 9 123 (charged at a national rate)\nEmail: complaint.info@financial-ombudsman.org.uk\nWebsite: www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk\nYours sincerely\n{{name_of_contact_point}}\n{{job_title}}\nEnc. ‘your complaint and the ombudsman’ leaflet",
