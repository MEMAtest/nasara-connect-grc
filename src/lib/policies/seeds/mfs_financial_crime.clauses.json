The risk appetite statement establishes the parameters for financial crime risk management and guides decision-making processes. It is reviewed quarterly to ensure alignment with evolving business needs and regulatory landscapes.\n\nCore Principles: {{firm.name}} adopts a conservative risk appetite, particularly in areas associated with financial crime, and commits to the following principles:\n- Geographic Focus: Preference for transactions within EU corridors, deemed lower risk due to strong regulatory frameworks. Transactions involving FATF-listed jurisdictions are excluded unless under exceptional circumstances, approved by the MLRO.\n- Customer Risk: Priority is given to SMEs operating within clearly defined industries. High-risk sectors (e.g., gambling, cryptocurrency) require enhanced due diligence and explicit MLRO approval.\n- Sanctions Compliance: Strict adherence to international sanctions, with no tolerance for transactions involving sanctioned entities, jurisdictions, or individuals.\n- Product Risk: While {{firm.name}} offers money remittance services, which are inherently high-risk, the firm effectively manages this risk by implementing a robust control framework.\n- Channel Risk: {{firm.name}} acquires its clients through online channels exclusively. To monitor and mitigate channel risk, {{firm.name}} will implement a robust system that includes ID&V (Identity & Verification) and name screening checks.\n\nAlignment with Domestic and International Regulatory Requirements\n{{firm.name}} adheres to all applicable laws and regulations, including but not limited to the following:\n- UK Regulations: The Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2017, Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (POCA), FCA’s Financial Crime Guide (FCG), and the Senior Managers and Certification Regime (SM&CR).\n- International Standards: FATF Recommendations, EU AML Directives, and applicable sanctions laws (e.g., OFAC, UN, EU).\nWhere conflicts arise between domestic and international regulations, the MLRO escalates the issue to senior management for resolution. Decisions are documented, prioritising the stricter standard unless otherwise justified and approved.",

Each issue is assigned a unique identifier and categorised based on its severity and nature (e.g., sanctions, suspicious activity, or PEP-related).\n- Preliminary AssessmentThe MLRO conducts an initial review to determine the root cause and immediate implications of the issue. This review includes:\n- Verifying the transaction details or flagged activity.\n- Cross-referencing against sanctions lists and customer due diligence records.\n- Reviewing the transaction history and any linked accounts or entities.\n- Risk AssessmentThe issue is assessed against the firm’s financial crime risk matrix, considering factors such as the customer’s risk profile, geographic risk, and transaction type. For example:\n- High-risk issues are escalated immediately to senior management and, if necessary, reported to external authorities such as the National Crime Agency (NCA).\n- Medium-risk issues are subjected to enhanced due diligence, which may involve requesting additional information from the customer or beneficiary.\n- Low-risk issues are logged and resolved within the compliance team’s standard processes.\n- Decision and EscalationHigh-risk issues that require immediate escalation follow the firm’s escalation process:\n- Internal Escalation: The MLRO briefs the Board of Directors within 24 hours, outlining the issue, potential impact, and recommended actions.\n- External Reporting: If the issue qualifies as suspicious activity, the MLRO ensures a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) is submitted to the NCA promptly.\n- Regulatory Notification: Where applicable, the FCA is notified of significant issues, in line with Principle 11 requirements.\n- Resolution and DocumentationOnce a decision is reached, the MLRO oversees the resolution process, which may involve freezing accounts, blocking transactions, or engaging with third-party payment providers. The following steps are taken:\n- A clear resolution plan is implemented to mitigate risks and prevent recurrence.\n- Detailed records of the issue, investigation, and resolution are maintained for audit and regulatory review.\n- Post-Incident ReviewFollowing the resolution of a logged issue, a post-incident review is conducted to identify lessons learned and implement improvements. This includes:\n- Evaluating the effectiveness of existing controls in preventing the issue.\n- Updating policies, procedures, or thresholds where gaps are identified.\n- Providing targeted training to staff to address knowledge gaps or emerging risks.",

Escalation triggers include:\n- Transactions involving sanctioned jurisdictions or entities.\n- Suspicious patterns that may indicate layering or structuring.\n- Repeated issues with a specific customer or counterparty.\n- Multi-Layered Review Process\n- The MLRO conducts a structured analysis, considering:\n- Customer risk profile and transaction history.\n- Corresponding data from external sources (e.g., adverse media, sanctions lists).\n- The MLRO engages with internal subject matter experts, if necessary, to validate findings.\n- Decision-Making and SAR Filing\n- The MLRO determines whether a SAR should be filed. Criteria include:\n- Evidence of money laundering or financial crime.\n- The materiality of the transaction.\n- Whether the activity aligns with regulatory reporting thresholds.\n- If a SAR is warranted, it is submitted via the NCA’s SAR Online portal within prescribed timelines.\n- Post-Escalation Actions\n- Transactions and accounts flagged during the escalation process are subject to:\n- Enhanced monitoring for recurring or evolving risks.\n- Temporary holds or restrictions, if necessary, to mitigate immediate risks.\n- All decisions and actions are logged to maintain a comprehensive audit trail.\nExample Escalation Pathway:\n| Escalation Stage | Responsible Party | Key Actions |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Initial Flagging | Compliance Analyst | Review flagged activity, gather data |\n| Preliminary Review | MLRO Deputy | Verify context, assess severity |\n| High-Risk Escalation | MLRO | Investigate, liaise with stakeholders |\n| Decision and Filing | MLRO | Prepare and submit SAR to the NCA |\n| Post-Escalation Monitoring | Compliance Team | Implement enhanced oversight |",

Regulatory developments, including updates to legislation, FCA guidance or industry standards, receive particular attention through systematic monitoring of regulatory communications and industry updates. Internal drivers, such as audit findings, incident reviews or operational feedback, undergo structured assessment to determine necessary framework adjustments.\nThe MLRO conducts thorough impact analysis for proposed changes, considering implications for existing controls, resource requirements and operational processes. This analysis extends beyond immediate procedural impacts to consider broader effects on risk assessment methodology, monitoring parameters and staff training requirements. Where changes affect technological solutions, the assessment includes detailed review of system modifications and testing requirements.",
