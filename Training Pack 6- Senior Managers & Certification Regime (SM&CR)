Training Pack 6: Senior Managers & Certification Regime (SM&CR)
ðŸŽ¯ Topic Overview
Introduction:
The Senior Managers & Certification Regime (SM&CR) is the FCA's framework for individual accountability in financial services. It aims to reduce harm to consumers and strengthen market integrity by making individuals at all levels more responsible for their actions. It is designed to ensure there are no gaps where responsibility for wrongdoing can be hidden. This module explains the three core components of the regime and, most importantly, the set of Conduct Rules that apply to almost every single person working in the firm.

Learning Outcomes:
By the end of this module, you will be able to:

Describe the three main pillars of the SM&CR: the Senior Managers Regime, the Certification Regime, and the Conduct Rules.

List the five Tier 1 Conduct Rules that apply to all employees.

Understand the concept of "reasonable steps" for Senior Managers.

Recognise the consequences of breaching a Conduct Rule.

Explain how the SM&CR promotes a culture of personal accountability.

ðŸŽ¬ Hook Section
Who is responsible when something goes wrong at a financial firm? Is it an anonymous "computer says no" error? Is it a vague "failure of process"? The regulator says no. The SM&CR makes it clear that behind every action, decision, and process, there is an individual who is accountable. This regime is the end of hiding in the crowd. It means your personal conduct, integrity, and competence are under the microscope. It ensures that from the CEO down to the most junior team member, everyone understands their personal duty to protect our customers and the integrity of the market.

Real-World Example: The TSB IT Migration Failure
In 2018, TSB Bank suffered a catastrophic IT migration failure that locked millions of customers out of their accounts for a prolonged period. The subsequent investigation by the regulators focused heavily on the accountability of the bank's senior managers under the SM&CR. The FCA and PRA ultimately fined TSB Â£48.65 million. The investigation highlighted that senior managers had not taken "reasonable steps" to ensure the firm's IT systems were resilient and that the risks of the migration were properly managed. This case is a stark reminder that under SM&CR, senior leaders are directly accountable for the operational failures that happen on their watch.

Section 1: The Three Pillars of SM&CR
Content Text:
The SM&CR is built on three pillars, each covering a different group of people within the firm.

The Senior Managers Regime: This covers the most senior people in the firm who hold specific Senior Management Functions (SMFs), such as the CEO (SMF1) or the Compliance Officer (SMF16). Each Senior Manager must have a "Statement of Responsibilities" that clearly sets out what they are responsible and accountable for. They have a "Duty of Responsibility," meaning the FCA can take action against them if a breach occurs in their area and they cannot prove they took "reasonable steps" to prevent it.

The Certification Regime: This covers people who are not Senior Managers but whose job could cause "significant harm" to the firm or its customers. Examples include individuals giving investment advice or those with material risk-taking roles. The firm itself must "certify" these individuals as fit and proper to do their job, both upon hiring and at least once a year thereafter.

The Conduct Rules: This is the foundation of the entire regime. It is a set of enforceable rules that set the basic standards of personal conduct. Unlike the other pillars, the Conduct Rules apply to almost every single person who works in financial services, from the board of directors to the junior administrative staff. This is the part of the SM&CR that directly applies to you, day-in and day-out.

Section 2: The Conduct Rules â€“ Your Personal Obligations
Content Text:
The Conduct Rules are split into two tiers. The first tier applies to nearly everyone.

Tier 1: Individual Conduct Rules (Apply to ALL)

You must act with integrity. This means being honest, straightforward, and reliable.

You must act with due skill, care and diligence. This means taking your role seriously, having the right knowledge, and applying it carefully.

You must be open and cooperative with the FCA, the PRA and other regulators. This means never hiding, falsifying, or destroying information relevant to the regulators.

You must pay due regard to the interests of customers and treat them fairly. This is a cornerstone of our business and links directly to the Consumer Duty.

You must observe proper standards of market conduct. This means not engaging in any behaviour that could damage the integrity or reputation of the financial markets.

Tier 2: Senior Manager Conduct Rules (Apply ONLY to Senior Managers)
In addition to the five rules above, Senior Managers have four extra rules which codify their "Duty of Responsibility":

You must take reasonable steps to ensure that the business of the firm for which you are responsible is controlled effectively.

You must take reasonable steps to ensure that the business of the firm for which you are responsible complies with the relevant requirements and standards of the regulatory system.

You must take reasonable steps to ensure that any delegation of your responsibilities is to an appropriate person and that you oversee the discharge of the delegated responsibility effectively.
