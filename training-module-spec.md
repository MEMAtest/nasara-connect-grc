## Implementation Notes for AI Agent

### Critical Success Factors
1. **Engagement first** - If they don't complete it, compliance fails
2. **Mobile-optimized** - Most learning happens on commute/breaks
3. **Micro-learning** - Attention spans are short, make it count
4. **Practical focus** - Theory < Application < Real scenarios
5. **Evidence robustness** - Must withstand regulatory scrutiny

### Technical Requirements
1. **SCORM/xAPI compliance** for LMS portability
2. **WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility** standards
3. **Multi-tenant architecture** for client separation
4. **API-first design** for integrations
5. **Cloud-native** for scalability

### Content Priorities
1. **Start with mandatory** - AML, Conduct, SM&CR
2. **High-risk areas next** - Based on firm's permissions
3. **Role-specific paths** - Targeted not generic
4. **Regulatory updates** - Rapid response capability
5. **Continuous improvement** - Based on analytics
