Training Pack 7: FCA Authorization & Permissions
üéØ Topic Overview
Introduction:
Operating in the UK financial services industry is a privilege, not a right. Before a firm can offer financial products or services, it must be formally authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). This authorisation is not a blank cheque; it comes with a specific list of "permissions" that dictate exactly which activities we are allowed to perform. This module explains the concept of the "regulatory perimeter," the importance of our permissions, and why acting outside of them can have severe consequences for both the firm and its individuals.

Learning Outcomes:
By the end of this module, you will be able to:

Explain the "General Prohibition" and what it means to conduct a regulated activity.

Understand that the firm must meet the FCA's "Threshold Conditions" to be and remain authorised.

Describe what a "Scope of Permission Notice" is and why it's a critical document.

Recognise the risks of "scope creep" and acting outside of the firm's permissions.

Understand the consequences for the firm and individuals of breaching the General Prohibition.

üé¨ Hook Section
Imagine a doctor performing heart surgery without a medical license. The risk of catastrophic harm is obvious. In the financial world, the principle is the same. Giving advice, managing investments, or processing payments without the right qualifications and regulatory oversight can lead to devastating financial harm for consumers. That's why the FCA acts as a gatekeeper. They don't just let anyone set up a financial firm. They put applicants through a rigorous, demanding process to ensure they are ready, willing, and organised to meet high standards. Our authorisation is our license to operate. It is our promise to the regulator and our customers that we are fit and proper to handle their money and their trust.

Real-World Example: The Collapse of WealthTek LLP
In 2023, the FCA took urgent action against an authorised firm, WealthTek LLP, forcing it into administration. The regulator found that the firm was carrying out regulated activities, such as operating investments, far beyond the scope of its permissions, which were limited to advising and arranging. This unauthorised activity exposed clients to significant risk, and an estimated ¬£250 million of client assets was missing. The case is a powerful reminder that having authorisation is not enough; you must only perform the specific activities the FCA has permitted you to do. Straying outside those lines can lead to firm failure and massive consumer harm.

üìö Main Content (5-8 minutes)
Section 1: The Regulatory Perimeter & The General Prohibition
Content Text:
The foundation of UK financial regulation is a concept called the "regulatory perimeter." This is the boundary that separates regulated financial activities from unregulated ones. The rule that establishes this boundary is called the General Prohibition, found in Section 19 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (FSMA).

The General Prohibition states that no person may carry on a regulated activity in the UK unless they are an authorised person.

A "regulated activity" is a specific activity, related to a specific type of investment or product, as defined in legislation. Examples include:

Dealing in investments

Arranging deals in investments

Giving investment advice

Accepting deposits

Issuing e-money

Providing payment services

Breaching the General Prohibition by performing a regulated activity without authorisation is a criminal offence, punishable by up to two years' imprisonment and unlimited fines. Any agreements made by an unauthorised firm are unenforceable.

Section 2: Becoming and Staying Authorised - The Threshold Conditions
Content Text:
To get through the FCA's gateway and become an authorised firm, an applicant must prove it meets a set of minimum standards known as the Threshold Conditions. These are the absolute bedrock requirements for authorisation.

Crucially, a firm must not only meet these conditions to become authorised, but it must continue to meet them at all times to stay authorised. If a firm fails to meet any of these conditions, the FCA can take action, including varying its permissions or cancelling its authorisation altogether.

The key Threshold Conditions include:

Location of Offices (Effective Supervision): The firm's main business and management must be in the UK so the FCA can supervise it effectively.

Adequate Resources: The firm must have sufficient financial resources (capital and liquidity) and non-financial resources (e.g., capable staff, robust IT systems) for the scale of its business.

Suitability (Fit and Proper): The firm must be 'fit and proper'. This means its management must have integrity and competence, and its business model must be suitable and not pose a risk to consumers or market integrity.

Business Model: The firm's strategy for doing business must be clear, well-defined, and sustainable.

Section 3: Our Permissions - The Scope of Permission Notice
Content Text:
When the FCA authorises a firm, it issues a critical document called a Scope of Permission Notice. This notice sets out, in black and white, exactly what the firm is permitted to do. It details:

The specific regulated activities the firm can carry on (e.g., "advising on investments").

The types of investments or products these activities relate to (e.g., "shares," "debentures").

The types of customers the firm can deal with (e.g., "retail," "professional").

Any specific limitations or requirements the FCA has placed on the firm.

It is a fundamental rule that the firm must not stray outside the boundaries of its Scope of Permission Notice. Intentionally or accidentally performing a regulated activity for which you do not have permission is a serious breach and is treated in the same way as a breach of the General Prohibition. This is why every new product, service, or business line must be checked against our permissions to ensure it is compliant.

üéØ Practice Scenarios (2-3 minutes)
Scenario 1:
A colleague in the marketing team has an idea for a new service where the firm would hold client money in a "holding account" to make future international payments quicker. Our firm's permissions allow us to provide payment services, but not to accept deposits.

Question: What is the key risk here, and what should the marketing colleague do before developing the idea further?
Answer: The key risk is that "holding client money" could be interpreted as the regulated activity of "accepting deposits," for which the firm does not have permission. This could be a breach of the General Prohibition. The colleague must immediately refer the proposal to the Compliance team to analyse whether the idea falls within the firm's existing permissions before any further work is done.

Scenario 2:
A customer asks you for your opinion on a specific stock they are thinking of buying. Your role is in customer support, and the firm has permission to arrange deals but not to give investment advice. You have a personal interest in stocks and believe it's a good investment.

Question: What should you say to the customer?
Answer: You must not give your opinion. Giving a personal recommendation on the merits of buying a specific investment would be the regulated activity of "advising on investments," for which you and the firm are not authorised. You should politely explain that you are not permitted to give advice and can only provide factual information or process their instructions.

üìù Assessment Questions
What is the name of the rule in FSMA that forbids firms from carrying on regulated activities without authorisation?

Answer: The General Prohibition (Section 19 of FSMA).

The FCA's minimum standards that a firm must meet to become and remain authorised are called what?

Answer: The Threshold Conditions.

What is the name of the document issued by the FCA that details a firm's specific permissions?

Answer: The Scope of Permission Notice.

Breaching the General Prohibition is a civil offence, meaning it can only result in a fine. True or False?

Answer: False. It is a criminal offence, punishable by fines and imprisonment.

What does the "Suitability" Threshold Condition require of a firm?

Answer: It requires the firm and its management to be "fit and proper," demonstrating integrity, competence, and a suitable business model.

In the WealthTek LLP case, what was the core reason the FCA shut the firm down?

Answer: The firm was operating investments and carrying out activities far beyond the scope of its limited permissions, causing significant consumer harm.

A firm is authorised in Germany and wants to do business in the UK. Can it do so without getting separate FCA authorisation?

Answer: It depends on the specific post-Brexit arrangements, but generally, a firm needs to be authorised by the FCA to conduct regulated activities in the UK, although there are specific regimes for overseas firms.

Why is it important for a firm to have its main offices and management in the UK?

Answer: So that the FCA can effectively supervise the firm, which is one of the Threshold Conditions.

"Scope creep" refers to what risk?

Answer: The risk of a firm gradually and unintentionally beginning to perform regulated activities that are outside the scope of its permissions.

Who is ultimately responsible for ensuring the firm only operates within its permissions?

Answer: While it is everyone's responsibility to be aware of the limits, accountability ultimately rests with the firm's Senior Managers.

üéâ Summary & Takeaways
Key Points:

You cannot perform a regulated activity in the UK without FCA authorisation. This is the General Prohibition.

The firm must meet the Threshold Conditions at all times to remain authorised.

Our Scope of Permission Notice is our rulebook‚Äîwe must not act outside of it.

Acting outside our permissions is a serious breach with severe consequences.

Always check with Compliance if you are unsure whether a new idea or activity is permitted.

Next Steps:
Our permissions to handle customer money bring specific obligations. The next module, "üí≥ Payment Services & E-Money Regulations," will explore the detailed rules that govern how we must operate as a payment services firm.
