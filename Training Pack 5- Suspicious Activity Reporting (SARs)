Training Pack 5: Suspicious Activity Reporting (SARs)
üéØ Topic Overview
Introduction:
All our checks, diligence, and monitoring lead to one critical question: what do we do when we suspect something is wrong? A Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) is the formal mechanism for reporting knowledge or suspicion of money laundering or terrorist financing. This module covers your personal legal obligation to report suspicion, the internal process for doing so, and the critical offence of "tipping off." Understanding how to identify and report suspicion is not just a company policy; it is a legal duty that protects you and the firm from criminal liability.

Learning Outcomes:
By the end of this module, you will be able to:

Define what constitutes "suspicion" in the context of money laundering.

Describe the internal process for escalating suspicions to the Money Laundering Reporting Officer (MLRO).

Understand your legal obligations under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (POCA).

Explain the criminal offence of "tipping off" and its consequences.

Differentiate between a standard SAR and a Defence Against Money Laundering (DAML) SAR.

üé¨ Hook Section
What does money laundering actually look like? It's not always a suitcase full of cash. It can be a series of small, unusual payments. It can be a customer suddenly moving large sums inconsistent with their known business. It can be a refusal to provide information about the source of their funds. These are the red flags. Your gut feeling that "something isn't right" is often the first sign. Your legal duty is to turn that feeling into an action by reporting it internally. Ignoring it doesn't just put the firm at risk; under the law, it can make you personally complicit in the crime.

Real-World Example: The Coutts & Co Fine
In 2012, the private bank Coutts & Co was fined ¬£8.75 million by the FSA (the FCA's predecessor) for significant and widespread failings in its AML controls, particularly concerning high-risk and PEP clients. A key finding was the bank's failure to exit suspicious customer relationships and, crucially, its failure to submit SARs to the authorities in a timely manner, even when internal reviews had identified major red flags. The case demonstrated that identifying risk is useless if you don't act on it by reporting your suspicions.

üìö Main Content (5-8 minutes)
Section 1: What is Suspicion?
Content Text:
The legal requirement to report is based on the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (POCA). This act requires you to make a report if you know, suspect, or have reasonable grounds for knowing or suspecting that another person is engaged in money laundering.

But what does "suspicion" mean? The UK courts have defined it as a state of mind that is "more than fanciful." You are not required to have proof or evidence that money laundering is occurring. You just need a genuine feeling of apprehension or mistrust that a transaction or activity could be linked to criminal property.

This is a subjective test. It's about what you suspect, based on your knowledge, experience, and the information available to you. Common red flags that can lead to suspicion include:

Transactions that are unusually large or complex with no apparent economic or legal purpose.

Activity that is inconsistent with the customer's known business or profile.

Reluctance to provide information about identity or source of funds.

Use of opaque corporate structures or offshore accounts without good reason.

Connections to high-risk jurisdictions, individuals, or sectors.

Your role is not to be a detective. Your role is to escalate your suspicion to the firm's expert: the Money Laundering Reporting Officer (MLRO).

Section 2: The Internal SAR Process
Content Text:
You must never report your suspicions directly to the National Crime Agency (NCA). Your legal obligation is to report them internally to the firm's nominated MLRO. The MLRO will then assess your report and decide whether to file an external SAR with the NCA.

Our internal process is simple: Recognise, Record, Report.

Recognise: You identify a red flag or have a general sense of unease about a customer's activity.

Record: Note down the key details. Who is the customer? What is the activity? Why do you find it suspicious? Be as specific as possible.

Report: Complete an internal SAR form and submit it to the MLRO immediately. Do not delay. Once you have formed a suspicion, the clock starts ticking on your legal duty to report.

Your internal report should be factual and clearly explain the reasons for your suspicion. The MLRO may come back to you for further information, and you must cooperate fully. After you have submitted the report, you must follow the MLRO's instructions and not take any further action on the account or transaction without their clearance.

Section 3: Tipping Off and DAML SARs
Content Text:
This is one of the most critical rules in the entire AML regime. It is a criminal offence under POCA to "tip off" a person that you have submitted a SAR on them, or that they are the subject of a money laundering investigation.

This means you must not:

Tell the customer you are filing a SAR.

Hint that their activity is under review for compliance reasons.

Warn them that law enforcement might be interested in them.

Tipping off can result in up to five years' imprisonment. The reason is simple: if you alert a criminal, they will move the illicit funds, destroy evidence, and disappear. You must continue to interact with the customer normally unless instructed otherwise by the MLRO.

Sometimes, we need to proceed with a transaction even though we are suspicious. For example, not processing a payment might tip the customer off. In these cases, the MLRO can submit a Defence Against Money Laundering (DAML) SAR, also known as seeking "consent." This report is filed before the transaction takes place. The NCA then has seven working days to respond. If they grant consent (or don't refuse it within the timeframe), the firm has a legal defence against the crime of money laundering if it proceeds with the transaction. Managing the DAML process is solely the responsibility of the MLRO.

üéØ Practice Scenarios (2-3 minutes)
Scenario 1:
An existing customer, a small IT consultancy, has an average monthly transaction volume of ¬£20,000. Suddenly, they receive an incoming payment of ¬£500,000 from a shell company in a high-risk jurisdiction. When you ask for supporting documentation, the director becomes evasive and says it's for a "new private venture."

Question: Do you have sufficient grounds for suspicion, and what is your immediate next step?
Answer: Yes, you have multiple red flags: a massive deviation from normal activity, a payment from a high-risk source (shell company in a high-risk jurisdiction), and the customer is evasive. This is more than enough for suspicion. Your immediate next step is to file an internal SAR with the MLRO and await instructions.

Scenario 2:
You submit an internal SAR on a customer. The next day, the customer calls you to ask why a payment they were expecting has not yet been credited to their account.

Question: How should you respond, and what must you absolutely not say?
Answer: You should provide a normal, non-committal response, such as "I'm sorry, I can see there's a slight delay on the payment processing system. I will look into it and get back to you." You must absolutely not say anything that hints at a compliance review, a frozen account due to a report, or an investigation. Doing so would be tipping off.

üìù Assessment Questions
Under which UK Act of Parliament is the requirement to report suspicious activity established?

Answer: The Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (POCA).

The legal test for suspicion is objective, meaning you must have clear proof of a crime. True or False?

Answer: False. The test is subjective. You only need a genuine, personal feeling of apprehension that is "more than fanciful."

Who is the only person within the firm to whom you should report your suspicions?

Answer: The Money Laundering Reporting Officer (MLRO).

What is the criminal offence of informing a person that a SAR has been filed on them called?

Answer: Tipping off.

What is the main purpose of a Defence Against Money Laundering (DAML) SAR?

Answer: To seek consent from the National Crime Agency to proceed with a transaction that you are suspicious about, thereby giving the firm a legal defence against a money laundering charge.

The MLRO reviews your internal SAR and decides not to report it to the National Crime Agency. Have you fulfilled your legal duty?

Answer: Yes. Your personal legal duty is to report your suspicion internally to the MLRO. The decision on external reporting rests with them.

A customer's transaction seems unusual, but you can think of a possible legitimate explanation for it. Should you still report it?

Answer: Yes. The presence of a possible innocent explanation does not remove a suspicion. You should report the facts as you see them and include the possible explanation in your report. Let the MLRO make the final determination.

In the Coutts & Co case, what was a key SAR-related failure?

Answer: The bank failed to submit SARs in a timely manner, even when it had identified significant red flags and suspicious activity with high-risk clients.

After submitting an internal SAR, the MLRO places a temporary hold on the customer's account. The customer contacts you demanding to know why. What should you do?

Answer: You should not reveal the reason for the hold. You should escalate the customer's query to the MLRO, who will advise on the appropriate response to avoid tipping off.

How long does the National Crime Agency have to respond to a DAML SAR before consent is deemed to have been granted?

Answer: Seven working days from the day after the report is submitted.

üéâ Summary & Takeaways
Key Points:

You have a personal legal duty to report suspicion of money laundering to the MLRO.

Suspicion is a subjective feeling that something is not right; you do not need proof.

The internal process is: Recognise, Record, Report to the MLRO.

Never tip off a customer. This is a serious criminal offence.

The MLRO is the firm's expert and the gatekeeper for all external reports to the authorities.

Next Steps:
Understanding our duties under POCA is a core part of our regulatory obligations. The next module, "üìã Senior Managers & Certification Regime (SM&CR)", will explore the wider framework of individual accountability and conduct rules that apply to everyone in the firm.
