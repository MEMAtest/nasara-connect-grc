Training Pack 3: Sanctions & Financial Crime Prevention
üéØ Topic Overview
Introduction:
Financial sanctions are a powerful foreign policy and national security tool used by governments to combat terrorism, human rights abuses, and other illicit activities. For our firm, complying with sanctions is not just a regulatory requirement‚Äîit is a legal imperative. This module explains what sanctions are, how we screen for them, and your absolute obligation if you encounter a sanctioned individual or entity. A failure in this area can lead to severe penalties, including unlimited fines and imprisonment, and could involve the firm in financing some of the world's most dangerous activities.

Learning Outcomes:
By the end of this module, you will be able to:

Define financial sanctions and understand their purpose.

Differentiate between the main types of sanctions regimes.

Explain the firm's process for sanctions screening.

Understand the concept of a "true match" and the required escalation procedure.

Recognise the principle of "strict liability" in relation to sanctions breaches.

üé¨ Hook Section
Imagine processing a payment that inadvertently funds a terrorist cell or a rogue state's weapons program. This is the reality of a sanctions breach. Sanctions lists contain the names of terrorists, narcotics traffickers, and entities involved in nuclear proliferation. They are the "no-fly list" of the financial world. Our role is to act as the border control, ensuring that no funds or services from our firm ever reach these designated targets. The stakes are absolute, and there is no room for error.

Real-World Example: The Standard Chartered Bank Fine
In 2019, Standard Chartered Bank was hit with a staggering $1.1 billion fine by UK and US authorities for long-running and serious breaches of financial sanctions. The bank had processed thousands of transactions to individuals and entities in sanctioned countries, including Iran, Syria, and Sudan. The investigation revealed systemic failures in the bank's sanctions screening systems and a culture that overlooked clear red flags. This case highlights that sanctions compliance is a fundamental safety and soundness issue, and the penalties for getting it wrong are among the most severe in the financial sector.

üìö Main Content (5-8 minutes)
Section 1: What Are Financial Sanctions?
Content Text:
Financial sanctions are restrictive measures imposed by governments to achieve a specific foreign policy or national security objective. They are designed to prohibit or restrict a firm like ours from engaging in financial activities with designated "targets."

The primary body responsible for implementing and enforcing financial sanctions in the UK is the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI), which is part of HM Treasury.

There are several types of sanctions regimes we must adhere to:

Comprehensive Sanctions: These are broad prohibitions on almost all trade and financial transactions with a particular country (e.g., Syria, North Korea).

Targeted Sanctions: These are more common and focus on specific individuals, entities, or groups. They can be:

Asset Freezes: We must freeze any funds or economic resources we hold for a designated person and not make any funds available to them. This is the most common type of sanction.

Travel Bans: Prohibiting entry into the UK.

Restrictions on Financial Services: Prohibiting the provision of specific services, such as lending or insurance, to designated targets.

All UK individuals and legal entities, including our firm, must comply with UK sanctions legislation, primarily The Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 (SAMLA). We must screen against the UK Sanctions List, which consolidates all individuals and entities subject to financial sanctions in the UK.

Section 2: The Sanctions Screening Process
Content Text:
To ensure we comply with our legal obligations, the firm operates a robust screening process. We screen our customers, their beneficial owners, and relevant third parties against the UK Sanctions List.

This screening happens at two key stages:

At Onboarding: Before any business relationship is established, all new customers are screened. No account can be opened or transaction processed until the screening is complete and clear.

Ongoing Screening: Sanctions lists are updated frequently. Therefore, we conduct ongoing, regular screening of our entire customer base to ensure that an existing customer has not subsequently become a sanctions target.

When we screen a name, we are looking for a "hit" or a "match". This is where the name of our customer or a related party appears on the sanctions list. It is then the job of the compliance team to investigate this potential match to determine if it is a "false positive" (a common name or coincidence) or a "true match". A true match is a confirmed identification of a sanctions target.

Section 3: Your Responsibility - The "Stop and Escalate" Rule
Content Text:
Your responsibility regarding sanctions is simple and absolute. If you identify a true match to a name on the UK Sanctions List, you must:

STOP: Immediately cease all activity with the customer. Do not process any transactions, provide any services, or return any funds. The assets must be frozen.

ESCALATE: Report the match immediately to the MLRO. Do not attempt to investigate further or inform the customer yourself.

Sanctions compliance operates on a strict liability basis. This means that a breach occurs the moment you deal with a sanctioned entity, regardless of whether you knew they were sanctioned or intended to break the law. "I didn't know" is not a valid defence. This is why our screening processes must be robust and followed without exception.

The MLRO is responsible for formally reporting any confirmed sanctions breach or the identification of a designated person to OFSI. Failure to report is a serious offence. Your only duty is to stop and escalate internally.

üéØ Practice Scenarios (2-3 minutes)
Scenario 1:
During the onboarding of a new corporate customer, the screening software flags a potential match. One of the company's directors, "Mohammed Al-Hamad," has a similar name and date of birth to an individual on the UK Sanctions List.

Question: What are the immediate next steps? Can you proceed with onboarding?
Answer: You cannot proceed. The potential match must be escalated immediately to the compliance team/MLRO for investigation. They will use additional identifiers (like nationality, address, etc.) to determine if it is a true match or a false positive. Only when compliance confirms it is a false positive can the onboarding continue.

Scenario 2:
The firm receives an alert from its overnight screening system that an existing customer has just been added to the UK Sanctions List due to new government designations. The customer has a payment scheduled to go out later that day.

Question: What must be done with the customer's account and their scheduled payment?
Answer: The account must be frozen immediately. The scheduled payment must be stopped and must not be processed. The MLRO must be notified immediately, who will then be legally required to file a report with OFSI.

üìù Assessment Questions
What is the primary UK government body responsible for enforcing financial sanctions?

Answer: The Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI).

Explain the principle of "strict liability" as it applies to sanctions.

Answer: It means that a breach has occurred simply by transacting with a sanctioned entity, regardless of your knowledge or intent. Lack of awareness is not a defence.

An individual is on the UK Sanctions List and subject to an asset freeze. What two things is the firm legally obligated to do if it holds funds for them?

Answer: 1) Freeze the funds and not allow them to be moved or withdrawn. 2) Report the fact that they hold funds for a designated person to OFSI (via the MLRO).

What is the difference between a "true match" and a "false positive" in the context of sanctions screening?

Answer: A "true match" is a confirmed identification of a customer who is on the sanctions list. A "false positive" is an alert on a customer who has a similar name or details to someone on the list but is not the actual designated person.

Why is ongoing sanctions screening of existing customers just as important as screening at onboarding?

Answer: Because sanctions lists are updated frequently. A person who is not sanctioned today could be added to the list tomorrow, and the firm must be able to identify this immediately.

The UK's main piece of sanctions legislation is called what?

Answer: The Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 (SAMLA).

If you discover a true sanctions match, should you inform the customer that their account has been frozen due to sanctions?

Answer: No. You should not communicate with the customer about the reason. You must stop all activity and immediately escalate to the MLRO, who will manage all further actions and communications.

What is the key difference between a comprehensive sanctions regime and a targeted sanctions regime?

Answer: A comprehensive regime applies broad restrictions against an entire country. A targeted regime focuses on specific individuals, entities, or sectors involved in the illicit activity.

In the Standard Chartered case, the bank was fined for processing transactions to which sanctioned countries?

Answer: Iran, Syria, and Sudan were mentioned as key countries involved in the sanctions breaches.

What is the very first thing you must do if you identify a potential sanctions match during your work?

Answer: Stop the transaction or activity and escalate it immediately to the compliance team or MLRO.

üéâ Summary & Takeaways
Key Points:

Sanctions compliance is a strict liability legal obligation.

We must screen all customers at onboarding and on an ongoing basis.

The rule for a true match is simple: STOP the activity and ESCALATE to the MLRO.

Never deal with, or make funds available to, a person or entity on the UK Sanctions List.

Breaches can result in unlimited fines and criminal prosecution.

Next Steps:
Dealing with sanctions targets is one form of high-risk activity. The next module, "üë• Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) Identification", will focus on another category of high-risk customer that requires a specific and enhanced level of due diligence.

üì∏ Visual Assets
Asset 1 (for Section 1): A world map with several countries highlighted in red (e.g., North Korea, Syria, Iran) under the title "Comprehensive Sanctions". It should also have small "target" icons on specific individuals in other countries, under the title "Targeted Sanctions".

Asset 2 (for Section 2): A flowchart titled "The Screening Process". It should show: [1. Screen Name against UK List] -> [2. Potential Match Found?] -> (If No) -> [Proceed]. -> (If Yes) -> [3. Escalate to Compliance] -> [4. Investigate: True Match or False Positive?] -> (If False Positive) -> [Document & Proceed]. -> (If True Match) -> [STOP & FREEZE ASSETS].

Asset 3 (for Section 3): A large, simple graphic with a red "STOP" sign. Inside the sign, the text should read: "1. STOP all activity. 2. ESCALATE to the MLRO immediately. 3. DO NOT inform the customer."
