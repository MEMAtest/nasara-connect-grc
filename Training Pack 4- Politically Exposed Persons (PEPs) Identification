Training Pack 4: Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) Identification
üéØ Topic Overview
Introduction:
Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) are individuals whose prominent public role could make them a target for bribery or corruption. While it is not illegal to have a PEP as a customer, the risk they present to the firm is significantly higher. This module explains how to identify PEPs, their family members, and close associates, and details the mandatory Enhanced Due-Diligence (EDD) steps we must take to manage the associated risks. Properly managing PEP relationships is a key regulatory expectation and a critical part of our defence against corruption and money laundering.

Learning Outcomes:
By the end of this module, you will be able to:

Define a Politically Exposed Person (PEP), a family member, and a known close associate (RCA).

Explain why PEPs are considered high-risk customers.

Describe the specific Enhanced Due Diligence measures required for PEPs, including establishing the Source of Wealth and Source of Funds.

Understand the requirement for senior management approval for all PEP relationships.

Explain how ongoing monitoring for PEPs differs from standard monitoring.

üé¨ Hook Section
Power can create opportunities for corruption. When a person holds a position of public trust, they also hold the keys to public funds and influence. History is filled with examples of officials who have abused their power for personal gain, and they often need the financial system to hide and move the proceeds of that corruption. Our job is to ensure our firm does not become a conduit for such illicit funds. Identifying a PEP is not an accusation; it's a recognition of risk that requires us to ask more questions and dig deeper.

Real-World Example: The 1MDB Scandal
One of the world's largest financial scandals revolved around the Malaysian state investment fund, 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB). High-ranking officials, including the former Prime Minister of Malaysia‚Äîa classic PEP‚Äîwere implicated in a scheme that siphoned billions of dollars from the fund into personal accounts and lavish purchases. The money was laundered through a complex web of transactions involving major global banks, some of whom faced enormous fines for their compliance failures. The 1MDB case is a powerful lesson in how PEPs can exploit their position and the critical need for banks to scrutinise their source of wealth.

üìö Main Content (5-8 minutes)
Section 1: Defining a PEP
Content Text:
Under UK regulations, a PEP is an individual who is entrusted with a prominent public function. The risk is that they can be targeted for bribes or be in a position to misappropriate state funds. This high-risk status extends beyond the individual to their network. The definition covers three distinct categories:

The PEP: This includes Heads of State, government ministers, senior politicians, senior judiciary, senior military officers, and senior executives of state-owned corporations. It does not typically include junior or mid-level officials.

Family Members: The enhanced requirements also apply to the PEP's immediate family, who could be used to conceal funds. This includes spouses, partners, children and their spouses/partners, and parents.

Known Close Associates (RCAs): This refers to individuals who have a close business relationship with a PEP or who jointly own a business with a PEP.

The enhanced measures required for PEPs must continue to be applied for at least 12 months after they have left their public position. For very high-profile roles, the firm may decide to apply these measures for longer based on the level of risk.

Section 2: The Risk and the EDD Response
Content Text:
The primary risk associated with a PEP is that their wealth may have been derived from corruption. Therefore, the goal of our Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) is to gain a deep understanding of where their money has come from. This involves establishing two key things:

Source of Wealth (SOW): This describes the origin of the customer's entire body of wealth. It's about how they accumulated their fortune. For a PEP, this could be their official salary, inheritance, or legitimate business interests. We must obtain information to corroborate this story.

Source of Funds (SOF): This is more specific and describes the origin of the particular funds being used to establish the business relationship or conduct a transaction. For example, the customer's SOW might be a family inheritance, but the SOF for a specific ¬£100,000 transaction might be the sale of a property.

Establishing SOW and SOF for a PEP requires obtaining independent, corroborating information. We cannot simply rely on the customer's own explanation. This might involve reviewing public asset declarations, reliable media reports, or other credible public sources.

Section 3: Our Process for Identifying and Managing PEPs
Content Text:
Our firm has a clear, mandatory process for managing the risks posed by PEPs.

Identification: At onboarding, we screen all customers, beneficial owners, and key controllers against a comprehensive PEP database. This will tell us if they, or a known family member or associate, hold a PEP position.

Escalation: Any potential PEP match must be escalated immediately to the Compliance team for review.

Senior Management Approval: It is a legal requirement under the Money Laundering Regulations 2017 that the decision to establish or continue a business relationship with a PEP must be taken by senior management. This approval is mandatory before the relationship can proceed.

Conducting EDD: Once escalated, the Compliance team will undertake EDD, focusing on establishing and verifying the PEP's SOW and SOF.

Enhanced Ongoing Monitoring: For the entire duration of the relationship, all transactions related to the PEP must be subject to enhanced monitoring. This means a deeper and more frequent level of scrutiny to ensure that their activity remains consistent with our understanding of their profile and source of wealth. Any unusual activity must be investigated and, if suspicious, reported to the MLRO.

üéØ Practice Scenarios (2-3 minutes)
Scenario 1:
You are onboarding a new client who is the son of the Minister of Finance for a foreign country. He wants to open an account and deposit a significant sum of money, which he claims is a "gift" from his father.

Question: What is the client's status, and what specific EDD measure is critical in this case?
Answer: The client is a family member of a PEP and must be treated as a high-risk customer. Mandatory EDD is required. The critical EDD measure is to establish both the Source of Funds (the specific gift) and the Source of Wealth (how his father, the PEP, legitimately acquired the funds to give the gift). Senior management approval is required before opening the account.

Scenario 2:
An existing customer has been with the firm for five years with a standard risk rating. Through your ongoing monitoring, you see a news article announcing that she has just been appointed as a senior judge in the High Court.

Question: Does this change her status? What steps must the firm now take?
Answer: Yes, her status has changed. She is now a PEP. The firm must immediately re-classify her as high-risk and apply EDD to the existing relationship. This includes seeking senior management approval to continue the relationship, taking steps to understand her SOW, and placing her account under enhanced ongoing monitoring.

üìù Assessment Questions
What are the three main categories of individuals covered by the PEP definition?

Answer: The PEP themselves, their family members, and their known close associates (RCAs).

For how long, at a minimum, must EDD measures be applied after a PEP leaves their prominent public function?

Answer: At least 12 months.

What is the critical difference between Source of Wealth (SOW) and Source of Funds (SOF)?

Answer: SOW refers to the origin of a person's entire net worth, while SOF refers to the origin of the specific funds used in a transaction or business relationship.

Whose approval is legally required before establishing a business relationship with a PEP?

Answer: Senior management.

In the 1MDB scandal, what was the public position held by the primary PEP involved?

Answer: He was the Prime Minister of Malaysia.

Is it against the law for a firm to have a PEP as a customer?

Answer: No, it is not illegal. However, it is a legal requirement to classify them as high-risk and apply specific Enhanced Due Diligence measures.

A new customer is the CEO of a large, well-known publicly listed company (like Apple or Shell). Is this person automatically a PEP? Explain why or why not.

Answer: No, not automatically. A PEP is a senior executive of a state-owned corporation. The CEO of a private-sector public company is not a PEP unless they hold another qualifying position.

Why are family members and close associates of PEPs also considered high-risk?

Answer: Because they can be used by the PEP to conceal the proceeds of corruption and to obscure the beneficial ownership of assets.

What does "Enhanced Ongoing Monitoring" for a PEP involve in practice?

Answer: It involves scrutinising their transactions more frequently and in greater detail than standard-risk customers to ensure the activity is consistent with their known legitimate source of wealth.

You identify that a potential new customer is a PEP. They provide you with a letter from their lawyer confirming their source of wealth. Is this sufficient for your EDD?

Answer: No, it is not sufficient on its own. While the letter is a piece of information, EDD requires taking adequate measures to verify the SOW, which means seeking independent corroboration from public records or other reliable sources, not just relying on a document provided by the customer's own representative.

üéâ Summary & Takeaways
Key Points:

PEPs, their families, and close associates are automatically considered high-risk.

All PEP relationships require Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD).

We must establish and understand the PEP's Source of Wealth and Source of Funds.

Senior Management Approval is mandatory before starting or continuing a PEP relationship.

PEPs must be subject to Enhanced Ongoing Monitoring.

Next Steps:
Identifying high-risk customers like PEPs and uncovering unusual activity are key triggers for raising internal concerns. The next module, "üí∞ Suspicious Activity Reporting (SARs)", will cover the critical process of what to do when your checks and monitoring lead you to suspect money laundering.

üì∏ Visual Assets
Asset 1 (for Section 1): A network diagram titled "The PEP Network". A central icon labelled "PEP (e.g., Government Minister)" should have connecting lines to other icons: "Spouse," "Child," "Parent" (under a "Family" group), and "Business Partner" (under an "Associates" group).

Asset 2 (for Section 2): A side-by-side comparison. On the left, a large treasure chest with the label "Source of Wealth (SOW): The story of how they accumulated their entire fortune." On the right, a small sack of coins with the label "Source of Funds (SOF): The story of where the money for this specific transaction came from."

Asset 3 (for Section 3): A flowchart titled "The PEP Management Process". It should show the steps: [1. Screen & Identify PEP] -> [2. Escalate to Compliance] -> [3. Conduct EDD (SOW/SOF)] -> [4. Obtain Senior Management Approval] -> [5. Onboard & Apply Enhanced Monitoring].
