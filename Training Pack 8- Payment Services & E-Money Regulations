Training Pack 8: Payment Services & E-Money Regulations
🎯 Topic Overview
Introduction:
As a firm with permissions to provide payment services, we are subject to a detailed and specific set of rules that go beyond the general principles of FCA regulation. The Payment Services Regulations 2017 (PSRs) and the Electronic Money Regulations 2011 (EMRs) are the core legal frameworks that dictate how we must operate. These regulations are designed to protect customer funds, ensure transparency, and foster competition and innovation in the payments industry. This module covers the key requirements you need to know, especially around safeguarding client money and our conduct of business obligations.

Learning Outcomes:
By the end of this module, you will be able to:

Differentiate between a Payment Institution (PI) and an Electronic Money Institution (EMI).

Explain the absolute importance of "safeguarding" client funds and how it works.

Describe the key conduct of business rules regarding information provided to customers.

Understand the rules around executing payment transactions, including timings and liability.

Recognise the heightened consumer protection offered by these specific regulations.

🎬 Hook Section
When a customer gives us their money to make a payment, what is our single most important duty? It is to ensure that money is safe. It is not our money to use for our own business expenses. It belongs to the customer at all times until the payment is complete. This principle is called safeguarding, and it is the heart of the payment services and e-money regime. Unlike banks, we cannot use customer funds for lending or investment. Our job is to protect those funds in specially designated accounts, completely separate from our own. A failure to safeguard properly is one of the most serious breaches a payments firm can commit, as it puts customer money at direct risk in the event of firm failure.

Real-World Example: Ipagoo LLP's Safeguarding Failures
In 2019, the FCA forced the e-money firm Ipagoo LLP into administration. A primary reason for the regulatory action was the firm's significant and persistent failures in its safeguarding arrangements. The FCA found that Ipagoo had not adequately protected client funds, mingling them with its own operational cash and failing to perform the required daily reconciliations. This meant that when the firm failed, it was impossible to quickly identify and return money to customers. The case took years to resolve, leaving thousands of customers out of pocket and highlighting the catastrophic consequence of not treating safeguarding as an absolute and non-negotiable duty.

📚 Main Content (5-8 minutes)
Section 1: The Regulatory Framework and Safeguarding
Content Text:
The UK's payments landscape is primarily governed by the PSRs 2017 and, for firms that issue e-money, the EMRs 2011.

Payment Institution (PI): A firm authorised to provide payment services, such as executing payment transactions, money remittance, or acquiring.

Electronic Money Institution (EMI): A firm that can do everything a PI can, plus it has the specific permission to issue electronic money (e-money). E-money is a digital alternative to cash stored on a card or an electronic device (e.g., a pre-paid card or online wallet).

The single most important obligation under both sets of regulations is safeguarding. This means we must protect funds that have been received from, or for the benefit of, a payment service user.

How do we do this?

Segregation: We must place all relevant client funds into a designated "safeguarding account" held with a bank. This account must be legally separate from the firm's own business accounts. The bank is notified that the money in this account belongs to our clients, not to us, so it cannot be used to offset any of our firm's debts.

Reconciliation: We must perform daily reconciliations to ensure the amount of money in our safeguarding accounts precisely matches the amount of money we owe to our clients.

Safeguarding ensures that if the firm were to fail, an insolvency practitioner can quickly identify and return the client funds with minimal delay.

Section 2: Conduct of Business Rules - Information and Transparency
Content Text:
A major part of the PSRs is ensuring customers are treated fairly and transparently. Before entering into a contract, we must provide customers with clear, easily understandable information about our services.

This includes:

Information about the firm: Our name, address, FCA authorisation details, and contact information.

Information about the service: A clear description of the payment service, how to use it, and how to give consent for a transaction.

Information about charges: Full details of all charges, fees, and the exchange rates that will be used.

Information about timings: The maximum execution time for the payment.

Information about rights: Details on liability, error correction, and the complaints process (including the right to go to the Financial Ombudsman Service).

This isn't a "tick-box" exercise. The information must be provided in a way that allows the customer to make a fully informed decision. Hiding fees in small print or using confusing jargon is a direct breach of these rules. After a single payment transaction, we must also provide the customer with clear information about the completed payment without undue delay.

Section 3: Executing Payments - Rights and Obligations
Content Text:
The PSRs set out clear rules for the execution of payments, creating a set of rights and obligations for both the firm and the customer.

Consent: We can only execute a payment if the customer has given their explicit consent.

Execution Time: For payments within the UK in sterling, we must ensure the funds arrive with the recipient's payment provider by the end of the next business day at the latest.

Unauthorised Payments: If a customer claims a payment was made from their account without their authorisation (e.g., due to fraud), we must immediately refund the amount unless we have evidence of fraud by the customer or that they were "grossly negligent" with their security details. The burden of proof is on us, not the customer.

Incorrectly Executed Payments: If we make a mistake and send a payment to the wrong place or for the wrong amount, we are liable. We must refund the customer without undue delay and are responsible for tracing the payment.

These rules create strong protections for consumers and place a high level of responsibility on us as the payment provider to ensure our systems and processes are robust and secure.

🎯 Practice Scenarios (2-3 minutes)
Scenario 1:
The finance department notes that the firm has a surplus of £1 million in its main business account. They also know there is £5 million in the client safeguarding account. They propose temporarily "borrowing" £500,000 from the safeguarding account to cover a short-term business expense, with a plan to pay it back next week.

Question: What is the fundamental rule this proposal breaches?
Answer: This is a catastrophic breach of the safeguarding rules. Client funds held in a safeguarding account must be completely segregated and can never be used for the firm's own operational purposes. This is known as co-mingling funds and is one of the most serious offences a payments firm can commit.

Scenario 2:
A customer calls in a panic, stating they have just checked their account and a £1,000 payment was made this morning that they did not authorise.

Question: According to the PSRs, what is the firm's immediate obligation?
Answer: The firm's immediate obligation is to refund the £1,000 to the customer without undue delay, unless it has immediate and clear proof that the customer acted fraudulently or was grossly negligent. The firm must then investigate the unauthorised transaction, but the customer must be made whole in the first instance.

📝 Assessment Questions
What is the core principle of keeping client money separate from the firm's own money called?

Answer: Safeguarding.

Can an Authorised Payment Institution (PI) issue e-money?

Answer: No, only an Authorised Electronic Money Institution (EMI) can issue e-money.

How often must a firm reconcile its internal records of client money with the balances in its safeguarding accounts?

Answer: At least once every business day (daily reconciliation).

If a customer claims a payment was unauthorised, who has the burden of proof to show it was authorised?

Answer: The firm (the payment service provider).

What was the key regulatory failure in the Ipagoo LLP case?

Answer: The firm failed to properly safeguard client funds, mixing them with its own money and not performing reconciliations.

Before providing a payment service, a firm must give the customer clear information on all charges and exchange rates. True or False?

Answer: True. This is a key conduct of business requirement under the PSRs.

What is the maximum execution time for a payment in sterling from one UK account to another?

Answer: By the end of the business day following the day the payment order was received.

A customer gives you a payment instruction. Later, they complain you made a mistake. They actually gave you the wrong sort code for the recipient. Is the firm liable for the error?

Answer: No. If the firm correctly executes a payment according to the unique identifier (e.g., sort code and account number) provided by the customer, it is not liable if that identifier was incorrect. However, the firm must make reasonable efforts to help trace the funds.

Money held in a safeguarding account can be used to pay the firm's electricity bill if the main business account is empty. True or False?

Answer: False. This is a fundamental breach of safeguarding rules.

The Payment Services Regulations are designed primarily to protect the profits of payments firms. True or False?

Answer: False. They are designed to protect consumers, increase transparency, and foster competition.
