Training Pack 1: Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Fundamental
🎯 Topic Overview
Introduction:
Anti-Money Laundering (AML) is a critical function for any regulated financial firm. It refers to the laws, regulations, and procedures designed to prevent criminals from disguising illegally obtained funds as legitimate income. This module provides a foundational understanding of what money laundering is, why it's a threat, and the core principles our firm follows to combat it. This is the starting point for all staff to understand their personal and collective responsibility in protecting the firm and the financial system from abuse.

Learning Outcomes:
By the end of this module, you will be able to:

Define money laundering and identify its three distinct stages.

Understand the key UK regulations that govern our AML efforts.

Explain the firm's Risk-Based Approach (RBA) to AML.

Identify the role and responsibilities of the Money Laundering Reporting Officer (MLRO).

Recognise your personal duty to report suspicious activity internally.

🎬 Hook Section
Every year, up to £100 billion from drug trafficking, human slavery, and terrorist attacks is laundered through the UK. This isn't just a number; it's the lifeblood of organised crime. Criminals need to make this 'dirty' money look clean, and they will try to use firms just like ours to do it. We are the gatekeepers and the first line of defence. What you do every day, the details you notice, and the questions you ask—it all matters. This training isn't just about rules; it's about understanding your role in a much bigger fight.

Real-World Example: The NatWest Fine
In December 2021, the FCA fined NatWest Bank over £264 million for failing to comply with money laundering regulations. The bank's systems failed to properly monitor and scrutinise suspicious activity in a customer's account, which saw around £365 million deposited, including £264 million in cash. This case shows the severe consequences—not just financial, but reputational—of failing to implement and follow effective AML controls. It’s a stark reminder that these rules have real-world impact.

Section 1: The "What" and "Why" of Money Laundering
Content Text:
Money Laundering is the process of taking criminal proceeds ("dirty money") and making them appear legitimate ("clean money"). It’s a vital step for criminals, allowing them to use the profits of their crimes without drawing attention to the illegal source. Closely related is Terrorist Financing, which involves providing funds for terrorist activities, even if the source of the money is legitimate.

The process of money laundering is typically broken down into three stages:

Placement: This is the first and riskiest step for criminals. They introduce their illegal funds into the financial system. This could be through cash deposits, buying foreign currency, or mixing cash with the proceeds of a legitimate business.

Layering: The goal here is to obscure the money's origin. Criminals create complex webs of transactions, often across multiple jurisdictions, to make the audit trail as confusing as possible. This can involve moving funds between various banks, creating shell companies, and buying and selling high-value assets.

Integration: This is the final stage, where the laundered money is returned to the criminal from what appear to be legitimate sources. This could be through fake invoices for services, property sales, or dividend payments from a company that was part of the layering process. The money is now "clean" and can be used freely.

Key Regulatory Requirements:
Our firm's AML framework is built upon a complex web of UK law and guidance. It is critical to understand that this is not just FCA rules, but criminal law. Key regulations include:

The Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (POCA): The UK's primary anti-money laundering legislation. It establishes the main money laundering offences, including concealing, arranging, and acquiring criminal property.

The Terrorism Act 2000: This act establishes the primary offences related to terrorist financing.

The Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds Regulations 2017 (MLRs): These are the detailed, practical rules that regulated firms like ours must follow. They set out the requirements for the risk-based approach, customer due diligence, and record keeping.

The Criminal Finances Act 2017: Introduced new powers to combat illicit finance, including Unexplained Wealth Orders.

FCA Handbook - SYSC 6 & The Financial Crime Guide (FCG): Sets out the FCA's expectations for firms' systems and controls against financial crime.

Joint Money Laundering Steering Group (JMLSG) Guidance: This is not law, but it is industry-approved guidance on how to interpret and implement the MLRs. Courts and the FCA will consider whether a firm has followed JMLSG guidance when assessing compliance.

Section 2: Our Core Defence: The Risk-Based Approach (RBA)
Content Text:
We cannot treat every customer and every transaction as if it carries the same level of risk. The law requires us to adopt a Risk-Based Approach (RBA). This means we must identify the biggest financial crime risks our firm faces and focus our resources on managing and mitigating them. It's an intelligent, proportionate way to fight financial crime.

Our RBA has four key pillars, which are detailed in our firm's AML Policy:

Business-Wide Risk Assessment: Our firm conducts and maintains a formal assessment of our AML risks. We consider the risks posed by our customers, the countries they operate in, the products and services we offer, and how we deliver them. This assessment is the foundation of our entire AML programme.

Customer Due Diligence (CDD): This is the process of "Knowing Your Customer" (KYC). We must identify our customers and, where necessary, their beneficial owners, and verify their identity. Based on our risk assessment, we apply different levels of diligence: Standard, Simplified, or Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) for high-risk customers like Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs).

Ongoing Monitoring: Our job doesn't end after onboarding. We monitor customer transactions and activity throughout our relationship to ensure it's consistent with what we know about them. The goal is to spot unusual or suspicious patterns that might indicate money laundering.

Reporting: This pillar covers our internal and external reporting obligations, which we'll discuss next.

Section 3: Your Role and the MLRO
Content Text:
AML compliance is a collective responsibility, but there are specific roles you need to understand.

Every employee has a fundamental duty. If, during your work, you see, hear, or learn something that gives you a suspicion that a customer or transaction is involved in money laundering or terrorist financing, you must report it.

Your report is made internally to the Money Laundering Reporting Officer (MLRO). The MLRO (who holds the SMF17 function) is a senior, independent, and authorised individual responsible for overseeing the firm’s AML systems and controls.

The MLRO's key duties include:

Acting as the central point of contact for all internal AML concerns.

Investigating internal reports of suspicious activity.

Making the final decision on whether to report this suspicion to the National Crime Agency (NCA) by submitting a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR).

Your process is simple: If you suspect it, report it internally to the MLRO.

CRITICAL RULE: Tipping Off
It is a criminal offence to "tip off" a person that you have made a SAR or that there is an ongoing investigation. You must never tell a customer that they are the subject of a report. Any communication must be handled carefully and with guidance from the MLRO.

🎯 Practice Scenarios (2-3 minutes)
Scenario 1:
A new corporate client wants to set up a payment account. They are based in a high-risk jurisdiction and the corporate structure is deliberately complex, involving shell companies. They want to immediately begin moving large, round-sum amounts to various other countries. The director is evasive when you ask for details on the source of their wealth.

Question: What are the red flags here, and what should you do?
Answer: The red flags are: high-risk jurisdiction, complex/opaque structure, immediate large transactions, and evasiveness about the source of wealth. This requires Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD). You must escalate these concerns immediately to the MLRO before proceeding with the relationship.

Scenario 2:
An existing customer, who has for years maintained a low account balance with minimal activity, suddenly receives a series of large, unrelated payments from abroad. Almost as soon as the funds arrive, they are transferred out to a different individual.

Question: Why is this activity suspicious, and what is your legal obligation?
Answer: This is suspicious because it represents a significant and unexplained change in the customer's expected activity. The account appears to be used as a simple pass-through for funds, a classic layering technique. Your obligation is to report your suspicion internally to the MLRO immediately.

📝 Assessment Questions
A customer asks you to split a large £50,000 cash deposit into five smaller deposits of £10,000 made on consecutive days. What is this money laundering technique commonly called and what is your immediate responsibility?

Answer: This is known as "structuring" or "smurfing". Your responsibility is to report your suspicion internally to the MLRO.

An employee suspects a client might be involved in money laundering but feels they don't have enough solid "proof". Should they still make an internal report to the MLRO? Explain your reasoning.

Answer: Yes, they must still report it. The legal threshold for reporting is "suspicion," not "proof." It is the MLRO's responsibility to investigate that suspicion and determine if it requires a formal report to the NCA.

How does the firm's Business-Wide Risk Assessment (BWRA) directly influence the level of Customer Due Diligence (CDD) applied to a new client?

Answer: The BWRA identifies high-risk products, jurisdictions, and customer types. If a new client falls into one of these high-risk categories, the firm's policy will automatically require Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) to be performed.

Referring to the NatWest case mentioned, what was the primary control failure that led to their significant fine?

Answer: The primary failure was in their ongoing transaction monitoring systems and processes, which failed to identify and act upon hugely suspicious cash deposits being made into a customer's account.

What are two potential legal consequences for an individual employee found guilty of the criminal offence of "tipping off"?

Answer: A prison sentence (of up to two years) and/or an unlimited fine.

Explain the key difference between Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing in terms of the source of the funds.

Answer: In Money Laundering, the source of the funds is always criminal activity ("dirty money"). In Terrorist Financing, the funds can come from legitimate sources (e.g., salary, donations) but are intended for an illegal purpose.

Which piece of UK legislation makes it a primary criminal offence to conceal, disguise, convert, transfer or remove criminal property?

Answer: The Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (POCA).

Is the MLRO required to report every single internal suspicion they receive to the National Crime Agency? Explain your answer.

Answer: No. The MLRO must first conduct their own investigation into the internal report. They are only required to submit a SAR to the NCA if they conclude that there are genuine grounds for suspicion.

Why is a Risk-Based Approach (RBA) considered more effective than a rules-based approach where all customers are treated identically?

Answer: An RBA allows a firm to focus its time, resources, and most robust controls on the areas where the risk of money laundering is highest. This is more efficient and effective than applying the same level of scrutiny to a low-risk client as to a high-risk one.

A customer is complaining about a delay in their payment. You know the delay is because the MLRO is investigating a SAR you filed. What is a safe and compliant way to respond to the customer?

Answer: You should use a generic holding response that does not mention the investigation. For example: "We are completing our standard internal checks and will process your request as soon as possible. Thank you for your patience." You must never mention compliance, money laundering, or an investigation.
