Training Pack 10: Market Conduct & Best Execution
üéØ Topic Overview
Introduction:
Our responsibilities do not end with protecting customer money and data; we also have a fundamental duty to uphold the integrity of the financial markets themselves. This means acting honestly, fairly, and professionally at all times. This module covers two critical aspects of this duty: firstly, the rules against Market Abuse, which are designed to prevent insider dealing and market manipulation, and secondly, the principle of Best Execution, which requires us to achieve the best possible result for our customers when executing their transactions.

Learning Outcomes:
By the end of this module, you will be able to:

Define the two main types of market abuse: insider dealing and market manipulation.

Understand your personal obligation to act with integrity under the FCA's Principles for Businesses.

Explain what "Best Execution" means in the context of a payment or foreign exchange transaction.

Recognise conduct that could be considered market abuse.

Understand the severe penalties for engaging in market abuse.

üé¨ Hook Section
A fair market is one where everyone plays by the same rules and has access to the same information. But what happens when someone cheats? When an insider uses secret information to make a guaranteed profit, or when a trader creates a false rumour to manipulate a price? This is market abuse. It's not a victimless crime. It erodes trust, disadvantages honest participants, and can destabilise the entire financial system. The regulator considers it to be one of the most serious financial crimes, and they have powerful surveillance tools to detect and punish it. This isn't just a concern for traders on a trading floor; the rules apply to everyone in our firm who might come into contact with sensitive information.

Real-World Example: NatWest Fined for Market Manipulation
In 2021, the FCA fined NatWest ¬£264.8 million for multiple failings related to market conduct, including instances where its traders manipulated the market for UK government bonds (gilts). The investigation found that traders had engaged in "spoofing"‚Äîplacing large orders they had no intention of executing to create a false impression of supply or demand and trick other market participants. This case demonstrates that even the largest firms are under intense scrutiny. It shows that market manipulation is not a theoretical risk; it is real, it is actively prosecuted, and the penalties are severe, reflecting the damage it does to market integrity.

üìö Main Content (5-8 minutes)
Section 1: Understanding Market Abuse
Content Text:
The Market Abuse Regulation (MAR) is the law that prohibits market abuse in the UK. There are two main categories you must understand:

Insider Dealing: This is when a person has access to "inside information" and uses it to their advantage by dealing in financial instruments related to that information. "Inside information" is precise, non-public information that, if it were made public, would likely have a significant effect on the price of a financial instrument.

Example: You are part of a team handling a large, secret money remittance deal for a public company that is about to acquire another company. This is inside information. If you bought shares in the target company before the deal was announced, that would be insider dealing. It is also an offence to disclose this information to a third party (tipping off) or encourage someone else to deal based on it.

Market Manipulation: This is the act of creating a false or misleading impression of the supply, demand, or price of a financial instrument. It's about tricking the market.

Examples:

Spoofing: Placing large orders with no intention of executing them to fool other traders.

Spreading false rumours: Posting fake news on social media about a company's financial health to drive its share price down.

Wash trades: Simultaneously buying and selling the same instrument to create a false impression of trading volume.

Market abuse is a criminal offence, with penalties of up to 10 years in prison and unlimited fines.

Section 2: The FCA's Principles and Our Duty of Integrity
Content Text:
Underpinning all market conduct rules are the FCA's Principles for Businesses. These are the high-level, fundamental obligations that all authorised firms must adhere to. The principles most relevant to market conduct are:

Principle 1 (Integrity): A firm must conduct its business with integrity. This means being honest, open, and fair. It is the absolute opposite of the deception involved in market abuse.

Principle 2 (Skill, care and diligence): A firm must conduct its business with due skill, care and diligence. This means having the right expertise and taking our responsibilities seriously.

Principle 5 (Market conduct): A firm must observe proper standards of market conduct. This directly links to our obligation to comply with the Market Abuse Regulation and not engage in any activity that harms the integrity of the market.

These principles mean that we are not only required to avoid illegal acts like insider dealing, but we are also held to a higher standard of behaving honourably and professionally in all our market-related activities.

Section 3: Best Execution
Content Text:
Beyond not harming the market, we have a proactive duty to achieve the best possible result for our customers. This is the principle of Best Execution. While often associated with stockbroking, it is highly relevant to our business.

When a customer asks us to execute a foreign exchange (FX) transaction as part of a payment, we must take all sufficient steps to obtain the best possible result for them. This is not just about the price (the FX rate). We must consider a range of "execution factors":

Price: The exchange rate we can obtain.

Costs: Any explicit fees or charges associated with the transaction.

Speed: How quickly the transaction can be completed.

Likelihood of execution and settlement: The certainty that the deal can be done.

Size and nature of the order: A very large or unusual transaction might require a different approach.

To achieve this, we must have a clear "Order Execution Policy" that explains how we weigh these factors to get the best outcome for our clients. We cannot just use a single provider for all our FX needs without checking if they are consistently providing a good result for our customers compared to other available options.

üéØ Practice Scenarios (2-3 minutes)
Scenario 1:
You are in the office kitchen and overhear a senior manager on the phone discussing a major, unannounced partnership with a publicly-listed tech company. You realise this news will almost certainly cause the tech company's share price to rise. Your friend is an active stock trader.

Question: What are your obligations under the Market Abuse Regulation?
Answer: The information you have overheard is non-public, precise, and price-sensitive, making it "inside information." You have a legal duty not to act on it yourself, not to encourage your friend to act on it, and not to disclose the information to your friend or anyone else (tipping off). Doing any of these would be a criminal offence.

Scenario 2:
A customer wants to make a large international payment and asks why the exchange rate you are offering is slightly different from the rate they can see on a popular currency conversion website.

Question: How does the principle of "Best Execution" help you explain this?
Answer: You can explain that under our Best Execution duty, we aim for the best overall outcome, not just a headline price. The "interbank" rate seen on websites is not a rate available to retail customers. Our quoted rate includes not just the price from our liquidity providers, but also factors in the costs of the transaction, the speed of settlement, and the guarantee of execution. This ensures we provide a reliable and competitive service that delivers the best possible result for them in the real world.
